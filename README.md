# O Cinema GatsbyJS/WordPress REST API Prototype

So I'm playing around with GatsbyJS and a modified REST API based off o-cinema.org's WordPress REST API to try to build a speedy static site. This is also an attempt to build my very first React component. Oooh!

This is a fork off of the gatsby-start-default repo. Its README.md file is here: https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-default/blob/master/README.md

NOTE: The `/public` folder of this repo was uploaded directly, rather than tying this repo directly to Netlify. This is because `npm run build` was compiled off my local development server, which has some additional fields to the WordPress REST API. I haven't pushed these changes to O Cinema's production server yet.
